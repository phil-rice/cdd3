# Shared Assertions
OK we can move assertions into EngineComponentData so that Usecases and Scenarios and Engines can all have assertions

Assertions are additive: a scenario has it's own, and the use cases (recursive) and the engines..

# Need to make sure that we use all given reasons
Venn diagram reasons

If I add something and it has a redundant reason it should probably still split. This is probably a strategy thing...
and very complicated to explain... So the default behavior should be good

We could actually do a 'find redundant reasons' in a report. That's pretty cool

# We want to seriously think about 'training' 'test' 'final' in the work flow
We want to learn from things, and be able to add code and go really quickly

# Structure should be considered: do we want a structure engine... 
This is only worth it if it goes a lot faster.

# JUNIT work flow
I think we just list engines in JUNIT: it's not automatic ... too hard to be automatic

#Reports
Need to be moved from Cdd2

#Website
Ditto

# Engines with currying etc and different arity
I think this is fairly straight forwards... need to try it

# Making engines easily from different use cases and maybe easy A/B testing and stuff...
